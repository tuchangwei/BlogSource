During a long time, I am thinking which programming language I want to learn on next step, Ruby or javascript, Android or Swift, and many times I can't make a decision. Ruby looks like very cool, but it is far from the region I contribute to, Android is near with the region, but sometimes I think it is boring.


Now, I don't want to waste my time any more. So I decide to do the following things next step:

1. Learn Swift.
2. Develop a music app using Swift language.
3. Rebuild the music app using Java language.

And then, Focus on mobile developing.
